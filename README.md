This is a top golf like game, in which the player aims the ball at targets down the fairway, and using correct timing, hits the ball.

Usage:
```bash
make
./main
```
You may use the arrow keys to move the camera at the moment, this is just for testing.


TODO:

I have basically created the skeleton for the rest of the project. All that is left is gameplay mechanics and loading more textures and lighting. It seems barebones at the moment, but
implementing more features will come quicker now. More is already on the way!
